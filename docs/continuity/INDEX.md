# VEXTREME — Continuity Index

**Read this file first. Always.**

This is the entry point for any AI instance (or human) continuing work on
this codebase. It tells you where you are, what's open, and where to go next.
It is maintained by convention — each session updates the Current State section
and the Open Work list before closing.

---

## If you are arriving cold

1. Read **Current State** below — one paragraph on where the system stands
2. Read **Open Work** — what was unfinished when the last session ended
3. Open the current batch file (listed under **Batch Registry**) and read
   the most recent session entry
4. Cross-reference `docs/README.md` for architecture decisions and load order
5. Use `docs/test-playground.html` (slug: `test-playground`) to verify the
   live system before touching anything

Do not start new work without reading the most recent session. Do not assume
the system is in the state described in the README — the README documents
intent, the continuity log documents reality.

## Current State

*As of Session 001 — June 29, 2026*

The GitHub-to-Squarespace loader pipeline is working end-to-end. Arc nav
widget confirmed rendering on `claude-answers-the-doubt`. Data (`arcs.json`,
`pages.json`) loads from jsDelivr with `?v=2` cache busting. The loader
chain resolves correctly: fetch data → load engines → load components →
auto-detect slug → mount widget. The archive renderer and section toggle
have not been tested live yet. Archives page still uses hand-authored HTML.

**Update this paragraph at the start of each new session** to reflect actual
current system state — not aspirational state.

---

## Open Work

*Carried from Session 001*

- [ ] Roll out new footer injection to all remaining pages (only
      `claude-answers-the-doubt` confirmed working so far)
- [ ] Generate new archives.html using the archive renderer
- [ ] Test `section-toggle.js` on the live archives page
- [ ] Test `bc-nav.js` on any page using it
- [ ] Verify `archive-renderer.js` token inheritance end-to-end
- [ ] Add `?v=` cache bust to stylesheet `<link>` tags if CSS changes
      don't reflect after pushes

**Update this list at the end of each session** — check off completed items,
add new ones discovered during the session.

---

## Batch Registry

Sessions are grouped in batches of 10. When a batch file reaches 10 entries,
create the next batch file and update this registry.

| Batch | File | Sessions | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | `docs/continuity/batch-001.md` | 001 | active |

**Active batch:** `docs/continuity/batch-001.md`

When starting a new session: open the active batch file, scroll to the bottom,
append your session block using the template at the bottom of the batch file.

When a batch reaches 10 sessions:
1. Create `docs/continuity/batch-00N.md` using the batch template below
2. Add it to this registry table
3. Update **Active batch** to point to the new file

## System quick-reference

*For when you need the answer fast without reading everything*

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Where is arc data? | `data/arcs.json` — all arcs, sections, entry slugs |
| Where is display data? | `data/pages.json` — presets, per-slug token overrides |
| Where is the loader? | `docs/squarespace-injection.html` — paste into Squarespace footer |
| Current cache version | `?v=2` — increment when lib/component files change |
| How do I test live? | Create page at slug `test-playground`, paste `docs/test-playground.html` |
| How do I add a page? | Add slug to `data/arcs.json`, optional entry in `data/pages.json` |
| How do I add a new arc? | Add arc object to `data/arcs.json`, increment cache version |
| Fonts loaded globally? | Yes — via header injection, no per-page font tags needed |
| Does every page need a per-page block? | No — URL auto-detection covers standard pages |
| What broke last time? | See most recent session in active batch file |

## Continuity rules

These rules exist so the log stays useful as it grows. Follow them.

**Reading rules:**
- Always read INDEX.md first
- Read the most recent session in the active batch before starting work
- You do not need to read old batches unless debugging something historical

**Writing rules:**
- Append only — never edit a prior session entry
- One session block per working session, regardless of length
- If a session is a continuation of the prior one (same day, same thread),
  note that in the Context on Arrival field rather than creating a new session
- Update **Current State** and **Open Work** in this file at session end
- Include the Claude thread link — it is the primary source of reasoning

**Batch rules:**
- Maximum 10 sessions per batch file
- When a batch is full, create the next batch and update the registry here
- Batch files are named `batch-001.md`, `batch-002.md` etc. — zero-padded
- Do not merge or split batches after creation

**What to log:**
- Files created or modified (with one-line description of what changed)
- Mistakes — specific, with cause and fix
- Assumptions — both confirmed and unconfirmed
- Open work at session end
- Thread link and instance/model info

**What not to log:**
- Blow-by-blow of what commands were run
- Content of files (that's what the files are for)
- Speculation about future sessions
- Anything you wouldn't want a future instance to treat as factual
