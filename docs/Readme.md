# VEXTREME — Frontend Architecture

## Overview

This repo holds the modular frontend of vextreme24.com, extracted from
Squarespace's Code Injection areas. The goal is a GitHub-hosted source of
truth that Squarespace loads from, rather than logic living buried in page
scripts.

---
---

## Stable baseline — v2 (June 29, 2026)

This documents the working state of the system as of the first confirmed
end-to-end render on vextreme24.com.

For the full session record — mistakes, reasoning, open work — see
`docs/continuity/batch-001.md` Session 001.

### What is confirmed working

- jsDelivr serves all files from `vgong24/vextreme@main` with `?v=2` cache bust
- `arcs.json` and `pages.json` fetch and parse correctly
- `arc-nav.js` loads after data, defines `VEXTREME_mount` cleanly
- Slug auto-detection from `window.location.pathname` works — no per-page
  block required for standard pages
- Arc nav widget renders correctly on `claude-answers-the-doubt`:
  dot rows for `epstein` and `claude_journals`, position row for `full_timeline`,
  "You are here" footer with correct page title

### What was fixed to get here

**Bug 1 — Dead DOMContentLoaded listener in arc-nav.js**
`arc-nav.js` registered `document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', mount)`
at load time. Since `arc-nav.js` loads dynamically after two async fetches,
`DOMContentLoaded` had already fired — the listener never executed.
Fix: removed self-mount entirely. The loader owns the single mount call.

**Bug 2 — Mount called before PAGE_ARCS was set**
The loader called `VEXTREME_mount()` before running the slug auto-detection
fallback. Mount saw `PAGE_ARCS = undefined` and returned early.
Fix: auto-detection now runs first, then mount.

**Bug 3 — jsDelivr serving cached arc-nav.js**
jsDelivr cached the old `arc-nav.js` (which expected `entry.url` not
`entry.slug`). Slug lookups returned empty even when data was correct.
Fix: `?v=2` cache bust appended to all `loadScript()` calls in the loader.

### Current load sequence (confirmed)

```
Header injection fires:
  → fonts loaded
  → design-system.css loaded
  → arc-nav.css loaded

Page HTML parses:
  → #arcNavMount div exists in DOM
  → window.PAGE_ARCS set (if per-page block present)

Footer injection fires (async):
  fetch(arcs.json?v=2)  ──┐
  fetch(pages.json?v=2) ──┴── both resolve
    → window.VEXTREME_ARCS  = arcs
    → window.VEXTREME_PAGES = pages
    → arc-nav.js?v=2 loaded (defines VEXTREME_mount)
    → archive-renderer.js?v=2 loaded
    → section-toggle.js?v=2 + bc-nav.js?v=2 loaded
    → window.PAGE_ARCS set via URL auto-detect (if not already set)
    → VEXTREME_mount() called — widget renders
    → window._vexReady = true
    → 'vextreme:ready' event dispatched
```

### Version markers

| Asset | Cache version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `arcs.json` | `?v=2` | 16 arcs, 75 timeline entries |
| `pages.json` | `?v=2` | 7 presets, ~30 slug entries |
| `arc-nav.js` | `?v=2` | v2.0.0 — no self-mount |
| `archive-renderer.js` | `?v=2` | token merge + entry row HTML |
| `section-toggle.js` | `?v=2` | localStorage collapse state |
| `bc-nav.js` | `?v=2` | shape-coded nav |
| `design-system.css` | no cache bust needed | served via `<link>` |
| `arc-nav.css` | no cache bust needed | served via `<link>` |

When making changes: update the affected files on GitHub, then increment
`CACHE_VER` in `docs/squarespace-injection.html` and replace the footer
injection in Squarespace.

## Squarespace injection — what goes where and why

Squarespace exposes two global injection points (Settings → Advanced → Code
Injection) plus a per-page Custom Code area. Each has a distinct role.

### Why this split exists

The old system was one large inline script in the Footer injection. It defined
`window.VEXTREME_ARCS` as a hardcoded object and `VEXTREME_mount` as an inline
function — all synchronous, all in one place. That meant:

- Updating arc data required editing the Squarespace injection directly
- No version history, no diff, no rollback
- Logic and data were inseparable

The new system moves everything to GitHub. Squarespace's injection areas become
a thin loader — three `<link>` tags in the header and one `<script>` block in
the footer. Nothing else lives there.

---

### Block 1 — Header injection

**Where:** Settings → Advanced → Code Injection → Header

**What it loads:** Fonts and stylesheets only. No scripts.

**Why header:** Stylesheets must load before HTML renders to prevent a flash of
unstyled content. Scripts in `<head>` block rendering, so nothing executable
goes here.

```html
<!-- Fonts -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Source+Serif+4:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;1,300;1,400&family=IBM+Plex+Sans:wght@300;400;500;600&family=IBM+Plex+Mono:wght@400&family=Cormorant+Garamond:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;1,300;1,400&family=DM+Mono:wght@300;400&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vgong24/vextreme@main/styles/design-system.css">

<!-- Arc nav widget styles -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vgong24/vextreme@main/styles/arc-nav.css">
```

---

### Block 2 — Footer injection

**Where:** Settings → Advanced → Code Injection → Footer

**What it loads:** Data → engines → components, in dependency order.

**Why footer:** Scripts in the footer run after the page HTML has parsed, so
`document.getElementById` and `querySelectorAll` work immediately. The loader
itself is a single self-contained IIFE.

**The load sequence is intentional and must not be reordered:**

```
fetch(arcs.json)  ──┐
                    ├── both resolve → assign to window globals
fetch(pages.json) ──┘
                         ↓
                    arc-nav.js        (reads VEXTREME_ARCS)
                         ↓
                    archive-renderer.js  (reads VEXTREME_ARCS + VEXTREME_PAGES)
                         ↓
                    section-toggle.js + bc-nav.js  (no data dependency, parallel)
                         ↓
                    VEXTREME_mount()  (called directly — DOMContentLoaded
                                       has already fired by this point)
                    vextreme:ready event dispatched
```

```html
<script>
(function () {
  'use strict';

  var BASE  = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/vgong24/vextreme@main';
  var DATA  = BASE + '/data';
  var LIB   = BASE + '/lib';
  var COMP  = BASE + '/components';

  // Guard: don't double-init if already loaded.
  // Catches the transition period where old inline scripts
  // may still exist on some pages.
  if (window._vexLoaderInit) return;
  window._vexLoaderInit = true;

  Promise.all([
    fetch(DATA + '/arcs.json').then(function (r) { return r.json(); }),
    fetch(DATA + '/pages.json').then(function (r) { return r.json(); })
  ])
  .then(function (results) {
    // Guard: only assign if not already set by an old inline script
    if (!window.VEXTREME_ARCS)  window.VEXTREME_ARCS  = results[0].arcs;
    if (!window.VEXTREME_PAGES) window.VEXTREME_PAGES = results[1];
    return loadScript(LIB + '/arc-nav.js');
  })
  .then(function () {
    return loadScript(LIB + '/archive-renderer.js');
  })
  .then(function () {
    return Promise.all([
      loadScript(COMP + '/section-toggle.js'),
      loadScript(COMP + '/bc-nav.js')
    ]);
  })
  .then(function () {
    if (typeof window.VEXTREME_mount === 'function') {
      window.VEXTREME_mount();
    }
    window._vexReady = true;
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('vextreme:ready'));
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.warn('[VEXTREME] Loader error:', err);
  });

  function loadScript(src) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      if (document.querySelector('script[src="' + src + '"]')) {
        resolve(); return;
      }
      var el     = document.createElement('script');
      el.src     = src;
      el.onload  = resolve;
      el.onerror = function () { reject(new Error('Failed: ' + src)); };
      document.head.appendChild(el);
    });
  }

}());
</script>
```

### Block 3 — Per-page Custom Code (optional)

**Where:** Each individual Squarespace page → Page Settings → Advanced →
Page Header Code Injection, or inside a Code Block on the page.

**Most pages don't need this block at all.**

The footer loader now auto-detects the page slug from `window.location.pathname`.
A page at `/claude-answers-the-doubt` automatically resolves to the slug
`claude-answers-the-doubt` and looks it up in `arcs.json`. Old pages with the
original `const PAGE_ARCS` pattern in their HTML still work — the loader reads
the URL and bypasses the stale inline call entirely.

**You only need this block if:**
- The page URL slug doesn't match the arc entry slug exactly
- You want to force a specific arc rather than all matching arcs
- The page is at a root URL (`/`) with no slug segment

**If you do need it — use `window.PAGE_ARCS`, not `const`:**

`const` is block-scoped and invisible to `arc-nav.js` which loads in a
separate script tag. It must be a property on `window`. And the mount call
must wait for the `vextreme:ready` event since the loader is async.

```html
<div id="arcNavMount"></div>
<script>
  window.PAGE_ARCS = [{ slug: 'YOUR-PAGE-SLUG-HERE' }];

  if (window._vexReady && typeof window.VEXTREME_mount === 'function') {
    window.VEXTREME_mount();
  } else {
    document.addEventListener('vextreme:ready', function () {
      window.VEXTREME_mount();
    }, { once: true });
  }
</script>
```

---

### Migration checklist — per page

Most pages need nothing touched. The footer loader handles slug detection
automatically. Only act on a page if the widget isn't appearing after the
footer injection is live.

**If the widget doesn't appear on a specific page:**

- [ ] Open browser console — look for `[VEXTREME] Loader error` messages
- [ ] Check `window.VEXTREME_ARCS` in console — if undefined, the fetch
      failed (likely jsDelivr cache). Increment `?v=` in the footer script.
- [ ] Check `window.PAGE_ARCS` in console — if undefined, pathname detection
      failed. Add the per-page block above with the correct slug.
- [ ] Confirm the slug in arcs.json matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**If a page has the old inline script and it's conflicting:**

- [ ] Remove `const PAGE_ARCS = [...]` — the auto-detection replaces it
- [ ] Remove `window.VEXTREME_mount && window.VEXTREME_mount()` — the loader
      calls mount after the full chain resolves
- [ ] Keep `<div id="arcNavMount"></div>` exactly where it is — this is still
      required as the mount target

**jsDelivr cache busting:**
When `arcs.json` or `pages.json` changes aren't reflecting on the live site,
increment the `CACHE` variable in the footer injection from `?v=1` to `?v=2`
(or any new value). This forces jsDelivr to fetch fresh files. The canonical
location for this change is `docs/squarespace-injection.html` — edit there
first, then copy to Squarespace.

The canonical copy of all injection blocks lives in
`docs/squarespace-injection.html`. That file is the source of truth —
edit it here first, then copy to Squarespace.

---

## How to add a new page

1. Open `data/arcs.json`
2. Find the arc(s) this page belongs to
3. Add an entry: `{ "n": N, "title": "...", "slug": "your-slug" }`
4. If the page needs custom styling, add a slug entry to `data/pages.json`
5. Add the per-page block (Block 3 above) to the Squarespace page,
   with the correct slug string

The slug is the last segment of the URL: `vextreme24.com/your-slug` → `your-slug`.

---

## Multi-environment deployment

The same codebase runs in three environments without modification:

| Environment | Base URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Squarespace | `https://www.vextreme24.com` | Primary public site. Formal sharing links. |
| GitHub Pages | `https://vgong24.github.io/vextreme` | Preservation copy. Forkable. Independent. |
| Local | `http://localhost:8080` | Development and testing. |

`arc-nav.js` detects the environment from `window.location.hostname` at
runtime and sets the correct base URL automatically. No per-environment
config needed. To override: set `window.VEXTREME_BASE_URL` before the
loader runs.

**Enabling GitHub Pages:**
Repo Settings → Pages → Source: main branch → folder: / (root).
The `index.html` at repo root becomes the landing page. Pages live in
`/pages/[slug].html`.

**Adding a page to the preservation archive:**
1. Copy the Squarespace page HTML into `/pages/[slug].html`
2. Remove the Squarespace wrapper (nav, footer chrome) — keep content only
3. Add the standard page shell (see any existing page in `/pages/`)
4. Add a link to `index.html`

**What "same logic, different base URL" means in practice:**
The arc nav widget on `pages/claude-answers-the-doubt.html` renders the
same dot rows as the Squarespace page. Clicking a dot on GitHub Pages links
to `vgong24.github.io/vextreme/pages/[slug].html`. Clicking the same dot
on Squarespace links to `vextreme24.com/[slug]`. Same data, same engine,
different hrefs — resolved at render time from the detected base URL.

**The migration map (`data/environments.json`):**
If a slug ever needs to differ between environments, add it to
`environments.migrationMap.entries`. This is the source of truth for any
future redirect or URL-rewriting logic. If slugs stay consistent across
environments (which is the goal), this stays empty.

## Continuing this build

If you are an AI instance or contributor picking up this project, the
continuity log is the right starting point — not this file.

**→ [`docs/continuity/INDEX.md`](continuity/INDEX.md)**

The index tells you the current system state, what work is open, and which
batch file to append your session to. This README documents the architecture
as it was designed. The continuity log documents the system as it actually is.

## Arc system concepts

### Arc
A named sequence of entries grouped into sections. Each arc has a `parent`
(the index page it links back to) and a `priority` (render order when a page
appears in multiple arcs).

### Entry
A single page within an arc. Fields: `n` (position), `title`, `slug`.
The slug is the canonical identifier — no full URLs stored in the data.

### Section
A named group of entries within an arc (e.g. "Phase I", "Arc II - Public Record").
Sections appear as visual gaps between dot clusters in the nav row.

### renderMode
Default: dot row with section gaps and prev/next arrows.
`"position"`: counter and arrows only, no dots. Used for `full_timeline`
because 75+ dots is not usable.

### Priority
Controls which arcs render first when a page appears in multiple arcs.
- `1` — primary arcs (the arc the page belongs to)
- `2` — cross-reference arcs (excavation, march_23_2026, dome, etc.)
- `99` — full_timeline (always last)

### Slug auto-resolution
When PAGE_ARCS is `[{ slug: 'some-slug' }]`, the engine scans all arcs for
that slug and renders every arc that contains it, sorted by priority. Dot
arcs render before position-only arcs (full_timeline).

## The display token system (pages.json)

Three-layer inheritance — later layers win:

```
_base  →  preset  →  per-slug overrides
```

**Presets** are named style bundles for recurring patterns:

| Preset | Used for | What it sets |
|---|---|---|
| `_base` | Default fallback | White bg, Source Serif title, IBM Plex Mono date |
| `tint` | record, journal, architecture | Background tint only, inherits _base |
| `accent-border` | walk-entry, god-pattern | Ember left border, ember title color |
| `immersive` | memoir, island | Large padding, italic serif title |
| `embodiment` | ascension-and-embodiment | Cormorant font, lg title, cream bg |
| `i-was-here` | i-was-here | Newsreader title, Martian Mono date, near-black bg |
| `dark` | firmament, cheatsheet, inside-the-experiment | Dark bg, gold text, full border |

**sectionDefaults** — if a slug has no entry in `pages`, the renderer checks
which archive section it lives in and applies that section's default preset.
Plain record, journal, and architecture rows don't need individual entries.

**Per-slug overrides** — any token field in `pages[slug]` wins over the preset.

### Adding a new entry with custom styling

```json
"your-slug": {
  "preset": "dark",
  "bgColor": "#0a0806",
  "titleColor": "#d4c080",
  "pills": ["dome"],
  "desc": "Optional subtitle shown under the meta row."
}
```

### Token reference

| Token | Type | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `bgColor` | hex | Row background |
| `hoverBg` | hex | Background on hover |
| `borderStyle` | `none` / `left` / `full` | Border presence and type |
| `borderColor` | hex | Border color |
| `padding` | `sm` / `md` / `lg` | Cell padding |
| `titleFont` | font key | Title typeface (`serif`, `cormorant`, `newsreader`, `mono-ibm`) |
| `titleSize` | `sm` / `md` / `lg` | Title font size |
| `titleStyle` | `normal` / `italic` | Title style |
| `titleColor` | hex | Title color at rest |
